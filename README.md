## Usage

[Example](https://github.com/iampawan/Flute-Music-Player/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart)

To use this plugin :

* add the dependency to your [pubspec.yaml](https://github.com/iampawan/Flute-Music-Player/blob/master/example/pubspec.yaml) file.

```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    flute_music_player:
```

* instantiate an Music Finder instance

```dart
//...
MusicFinder audioPlayer = new MusicFinder();
//...
```

# Fetch Songs

```dart
//...
var songs = MusicFinder.allSongs();
//...
```

### play, pause , stop, seek

```dart
play() async {
  final result = await audioPlayer.play(kUrl);
  if (result == 1) setState(() => playerState = PlayerState.playing);
}

// add a isLocal parameter to play a local file
playLocal() async {
  final result = await audioPlayer.play(kUrl);
  if (result == 1) setState(() => playerState = PlayerState.playing);
}


pause() async {
  final result = await audioPlayer.pause();
  if (result == 1) setState(() => playerState = PlayerState.paused);
}

stop() async {
  final result = await audioPlayer.stop();
  if (result == 1) setState(() => playerState = PlayerState.stopped);
}

// seek 5 seconds from the beginning
audioPlayer.seek(5.0);
```

### duration, position, complete, error (temporary api)

The Dart part of the plugin listen for platform calls :

```dart
//...
audioPlayer.setDurationHandler((Duration d) => setState(() {
  duration = d;
}));

audioPlayer.setPositionHandler((Duration  p) => setState(() {
  position = p;
}));

audioPlayer.setCompletionHandler(() {
  onComplete();
  setState(() {
    position = duration;
  });
});

audioPlayer.setErrorHandler((msg) {
  print('audioPlayer error : $msg');
  setState(() {
    playerState = PlayerState.stopped;
    duration = new Duration(seconds: 0);
    position = new Duration(seconds: 0);
  });
});
```

# Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1.  Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .
2.  If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3.  Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4.  Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
5.  Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/iampawan/Flute-Music-Player/issues) first, before filing an issue.
6.  Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
7.  Have fun!
